                    Spring is one of the four seasons experienced in many parts of the world. It occurs after winter and before summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, spring typically spans from March to May, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it occurs from September to November. Spring is characterized by milder temperatures, blooming flowers, and the return of green foliage as nature awakens from the winter dormancy.

                <h2>Cherry Blossom Festival in Japan</h2>
                <p>
                    The Cherry Blossom Festival in Japan, also known as Hanami, is an iconic and cherished annual event. Taking place during spring, usually in March or April, the festival celebrates the blooming of cherry blossoms, or sakura. People from all walks of life gather in parks, gardens, and along riverbanks to admire the delicate pink and white blossoms in full bloom. Hanami is not just about appreciating nature's beauty; it holds cultural and spiritual significance, symbolizing the fleeting nature of life and the concept of mono no aware (the transience of things). Locals and tourists alike partake in picnics, take leisurely strolls, and engage in festivities under the blossoms, creating a joyous and magical atmosphere across Japan.
